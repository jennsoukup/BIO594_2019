## Course Description
The course provides an in depth discussion forum for the current research and possibilities to answer long-standing and new questions in evolution and ecology using genomic tools. The course will discuss articles and reviews with a genomic perspective related to: Population and Conservation Biology; Natural Selection and Adaptation, Functional Genomics; Trait Evolution; Epigenetics and Phenotypic Plasticity, Symbiosis, Hybridization; Community Ecology and Metabarcoding; and Speciation. The genomic revolution, fueled by the easy to sequence RAN and DNA, has not only facilitated to answer old questions in ecology and evolution, but has also opened the possibility of new research areas. We will examine how genomics tools that are emerging and changing rapidly are transforming biology.


## Learning Objective
The goal is to recognize the diverse possibilities that genomics allow to answer evolutionary and ecological questions. Together we will enrich our conceptual understanding of genomics and the types of analysis that can be performed with genome scale data. At the end of the course participants will be able to design robust experiments to tackle their own questions and provide a detailed map of the methodological steps needed to carry out a robust study using genomic tools.


## General course organization
The first week of the course will consist on a review of the major aspects of genomics. We will then embark in a rich discussion of different disciplines of biology that use genomic tools. We will discuss at least two articles per meeting (some weeks three). Two participants will lead each discussion, and everyone has to be fully prepared to discuss articles in detail and submit a 500-word summary of the topic for that week. EVERYONE has to be prepared to be able to lead the discussion if I ask for it (even if you decide to not submit a summary for that week). EVERYONE should read the papers in enough detail that are able to discuss information in SUPPLEMENTARY material. This is ESSENTIAL to truly grasp the info in papers. It is the responsibility of the leaders to maintain a fluid conversation and bring new aspects into the discussion. The leaders will have to prepare a two-page summary (500-1,000 words) of the discussion and submit it within 48 hours after the discussion. I will lead the first discussion.

By the end of the class, and once students acquire some understanding of the possibilities to answer ecological and evolutionary questions with genomic tools, participants will write a research proposal that will be evaluated by their peers in review panels.  Reviewers and panelists will provide detailed criticisms to authors and authors will have one week to address criticism and resubmit their proposals. Upon resubmission, the authors have to write a one page letter highlighting the major issues found by reviewers and panelists and how they addressed the problems. Participants are evaluated both on the originality and effort to develop their own proposals as well as their detailed criticisms when acting as reviewers and or panelists.

### Grading

In accordance with the LSU grading policy, grades will be assigned using an A-F scale and the +/- system.  Grading is pretty simple:

Item                                               | # of assignments  | % of grade
--------| -------------   | ----------------
[Class participation ](#class-participation)          | 28                   | 20%
[Per class summaries] (#Per-class-summaries)                       | 6                    | 30%
[Research proposal]  (#Research-proposal)                        | 1                | 50%
Total                                           |                     | 100%

### Class participation
(20% of grade). To earn this portion of the grade students must actively contribute to all class discussions.

### Per class summaries
(30%). Before each week’s discussion, participants will have to submit a 500-word summary of the topic being assigned for that day. Each participant has to submit at least six summaries (5% each). The participant chooses which topics to submit summaries for. It is expected that given feedback by the instructor students improve their written summaries overtime.

### Research proposal
(50% of grade). This will involve writing a four-page proposal (excluding references) that seeks to answer an ecological or evolutionary question with genomic tools. Writing the proposal itself and addressing the panel and reviewer’s comments accounts for 30% of the grade. Providing detailed criticism of the proposals when reviewers or fully engaging in discussions during panels and writing panel summaries accounts for 20% of the grade.
